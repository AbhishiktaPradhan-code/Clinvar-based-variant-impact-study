#  Variant Impact Analysis: clinvar-based-variant-impact-study

##  Project Overview

This project aims to simulate a diagnostic gene panel analysis by evaluating and interpreting variants from three disease-relevant genes: **TP53**, **CFTR**, and **GJB2**. Using publicly available databases and prediction tools, we assess the clinical significance of each variant by comparing computational scores with known ClinVar annotations.

The goal is to demonstrate how computational predictions like SIFT, PolyPhen-2, MutationTaster, and CADD align or conflict with clinical significance labels. This helps build an understanding of variant interpretation pipelines .

##  Selected Genes for Diagnostic Panel Simulation

This diagnostic gene panel includes three clinically significant genes, each with well-characterized pathogenic and benign variants. These genes were selected based on their medical relevance, availability of variant data in public databases, and their utility in evaluating variant interpretation tools such as SIFT, PolyPhen-2, CADD, and MutationTaster.

###  BRCA1 – *Hereditary Breast and Ovarian Cancer*

- **Inheritance:** Autosomal Dominant  
- **Function:** BRCA1 encodes a 190 kDa nuclear phosphoprotein involved in the maintenance of genomic stability. It acts as a tumor suppressor and plays key roles in DNA repair (particularly double-stranded breaks), homologous recombination, and transcriptional regulation via interactions with RNA polymerase II and histone deacetylase complexes.  
- **Clinical Relevance:** Mutations in BRCA1 are responsible for approximately **40% of inherited breast cancers** and over **80% of combined hereditary breast and ovarian cancer cases**. It is a benchmark gene in cancer diagnostics with well-curated variant data across ClinVar, dbSNP, and related resources.

---

###  CFTR – *Cystic Fibrosis*

- **Inheritance:** Autosomal Recessive  
- **Function:** CFTR encodes a member of the ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter family. Unlike other ABC proteins, CFTR functions as a chloride ion channel and regulates salt and water movement across epithelial membranes in organs such as the lungs, pancreas, and intestines.  
- **Clinical Relevance:** Mutations in CFTR cause **cystic fibrosis**, the most common lethal genetic disorder in Northern European populations. The **DeltaF508**, which impairs protein folding and trafficking, accounts for the majority of cystic fibrosis cases. Its high prevalence and biological impact make CFTR an ideal inclusion in diagnostic pipelines.

---

###  GJB2 – *Non-syndromic Hearing Loss (DFNB1)*

- **Inheritance:** Autosomal Recessive  
- **Function:** GJB2 encodes **connexin 26**, a member of the gap junction protein family that facilitates direct intercellular communication via ion and small molecule exchange. These channels are essential for maintaining ionic balance in cochlear hair cells.  
- **Clinical Relevance:** Mutations in GJB2 are responsible for up to **50% of cases of prelingual, autosomal recessive non-syndromic hearing loss**. Its inclusion introduces diversity in disease mechanisms (sensory, not metabolic or oncological) and offers insights into high-impact missense mutations across varied populations.

##  Understanding Prediction Tool Discrepancies

Not all computational tools agree — and that’s expected. Each tool uses different models, biological assumptions, and data sources.

| **Tool**         | **Primary Focus**              | **Key Factors Considered**                             |
|------------------|--------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------|
| **SIFT**         | Protein function disruption    | Sequence conservation, amino acid substitution         |
| **PolyPhen-2**   | Structural protein impact      | 3D structure, domains, chemical properties              |
| **MutationTaster** | Disease relevance              | Gene models, known variants, splice impact, conservation |
| **CADD**         | Overall variant deleteriousness| Integrated score from multiple genomic annotations      |

###  Why Do Predictions Differ?

- **Transcript dependency**: Some tools score variants based on specific transcripts (e.g. MANE vs others). A variant might be missense in one transcript, UTR in another.
- **Conservation bias**: Tools like SIFT weigh sequence conservation heavily. Variants in less-conserved regions may be scored as benign despite functional relevance.
- **Scope mismatch**: CADD integrates regulatory and epigenetic features, while SIFT and PolyPhen are limited to protein-coding consequences.
- **Protein context**: MutationTaster may factor in broader gene context or clinical relevance, explaining why it sometimes flags more variants as “disease-causing.”

---

###  Takeaway

These differences emphasize the importance of:
- Using **multiple tools** for variant evaluation.
- Interpreting predictions **in combination with clinical databases** like **ClinVar**.
- Making room for **functional annotations and transcript-aware scoring**.

Consensus-based interpretation — or building your own scoring rubric — helps address these inconsistencies in a structured way.

Note: MutationTaster “Score” reflects internal classifier strength, not probability. Not intended for cross-variant comparisons. Use only as supporting info.

##  Summary Observations & Reflections

*  **Stop-lost and frameshift variants** are strongly predicted as pathogenic (e.g., CADD > 27, MT = Deleterious), aligning with known functional impact.
*  **Mixed predictions** seen for `17:43045726C>A` — SIFT predicts deleterious, but PolyPhen and ClinVar disagree → highlights need for clinical context.
*  **SIFT can produce false positives** in variants labeled benign by ClinVar, especially in genes tolerant to missense mutations.
*  **CADD scores show good alignment** with known pathogenic variants (>25), but scores between 10–20 are often ambiguous.

##  Interpretation Summary

- **Frameshift variants** (e.g., A9Gfs*36, F16Tfs*30, K162Pfs*5) are consistently marked as **pathogenic** by tools and ClinVar — reflecting strong disruption of CFTR protein structure.
- **Initiator codon loss** (`M1`) is interpreted as deleterious due to loss of normal translation start — supported by CADD and MutationTaster.
- **Two common SNVs** (C>T and G>C at 7:117479208) are unanimously predicted as benign, with low CADD scores or no protein consequence.
- **Intronic variant** (7:117535451A>G) is likely benign with no splicing or functional implications, matching ClinVar annotation.
- **No major disagreement** exists between tools and ClinVar for CFTR — predictions show high consensus in this dataset.

###  GJB2 Variant Interpretation Summary

- **Stop-lost and frameshift variants** (`13:20188976ins...`, `13:20189006delTG`, `13:20189017delCT`) are consistently predicted as **deleterious** by MutationTaster and labeled **Pathogenic/Likely pathogenic** in ClinVar, supporting strong concordance between computational tools and clinical annotations.

- **Missense variant `13:20189303C>G (M93I)`** is flagged as **deleterious** by MutationTaster and SIFT and also marked **Pathogenic** by ClinVar, demonstrating high confidence in functional impact.

- **Benign predictions** (`13:20188790G>A`, `13:20188817A>C`) lie in the **3′ UTR**, which is non-coding and often tolerates variation. Their **low CADD scores** and **benign ClinVar status** confirm low likelihood of disease relevance.

- **Mixed predictions for `13:20189125C>A (V153F)`**: CADD is **moderately high (20.4)**, but SIFT gives **low-confidence tolerance**, and ClinVar still classifies it as **Benign/Likely benign**, suggesting it may lie in a **non-critical or tolerated protein region**.

- **Overall**, **coding-region variants** with truncating or frameshift effects align well across all tools and ClinVar, whereas **non-coding UTR variants** tend to show consistent benign predictions.
